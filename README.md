# Open Jobs for Rackspace Platform Software Development and Engineering
The Rackspace Platform Software Development team is focused on software development iniativites that enable end users of cloud technology to more easily consume cloud infrastructure and easily deploy highly scalable applications.  We create the systems and automation that when put together create Platform-as-a-Service like capabilities that make the cloud very simple for applications developers and dev-ops engineers. 

If you are passionate about enabling others to simply and quickly build and deploy applications for the cloud, we encourage you to connect with us. We primarily do our work as open source, using python (for API control plane) + Javascript and leading web UI frameworks (like AngularJS, React, etc.) contributing back to open communities (like OpenStack, Docker, etc.), but we don't let open communities get in the way of us delivering incredible value to customers quickly and consistently with high quality. 

If you believe you have what it takes to help us, please apply.
