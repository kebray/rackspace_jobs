## Overview & Responsibilities
Rackspace is expanding our OpenStack community Solum product team.   
Solum is an OpenStack related project designed to make cloud services easier to consume and integrate

We value vendor neutrality, open design and collaboration, and leveraging existing solutions where possible. One example is our use of Docker for deployment of containers. Multiple language run-time environments will be supported with a modular "language pack" solution so you can easily run applications written in any language of your choice.
